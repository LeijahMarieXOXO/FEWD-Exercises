<p> Tell me friend, does hate coincide with love or can there be one without the other? This is a question that all creatures ruminate on, except for one, The Hobbit of course.</p>
    <p><strong>Upon which sword does love die, that of freidnship or family, war or peace?</strong> Love never dies according to the humble hobbit, for love is the blood of the earth and even dead things end up in the earth to create new life </p>
